the player to see a new boss bar with the current time in human readable 24-hour-format with
06:00 being the sunrise and 00:00 being midnight. The time is also indicated by the
value of the boss bar itself, which if empty at 00:00 and full at 23:59.
Next to the time, the current weather is displayed in three states:
- Sunny
- Rainy
- Thunder (at least if there was thunder in the last 60 seconds
